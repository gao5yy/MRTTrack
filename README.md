## Environment Installation

```bash
conda create -n sts python=3.8
conda activate tbsi
bash install.sh
```

## Project Paths Setup

Run the following command to set paths for this project
```
python tracking/create_default_local_file.py --workspace_dir . --data_dir ./data --save_dir ./output
```

After running this command, you can also modify paths by editing these two files
```
lib/train/admin/local.py  # paths about training
lib/test/evaluation/local.py  # paths about testing
```

## Data Preparation
Put the tracking datasets in ```./data```. It should look like:
```
${PROJECT_ROOT}
  -- data
      -- lasher
          |-- trainingset
          |-- testingset
          |-- trainingsetList.txt
          |-- testingsetList.txt
          ...
```

## Training
Download [SOT][] pretrained weights and put them under ```$PROJECT_ROOT$/pretrained_models```.
